                            <p>a)MHT CET is a multiple-choice question (MCQ) based exam.
                                <br>
                               b) Each subject (PCM or PCB) typically consists of 50 questions.
                               <br>
                                c)The total duration for each paper is 90 minutes.
                                <br>
                                d)There is no negative marking for incorrect answers.
                                <br>

                                Preparing for MHT CET requires a thorough understanding of the concepts, regular practice, and solving previous years' question papers. It's essential to manage time effectively during the exam and focus on accuracy.</p>
