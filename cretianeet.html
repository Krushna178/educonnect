       <p>the eligibility criteria for the NEET exam. Here's the information:</p>
       <h1>1)Nationality:</h1>
       <p>Indian nationals, Non-Resident Indians (NRIs), Overseas Citizen of India (OCI), Persons with Indian Origin (PIO), and foreign nationals are eligible to appear for NEET.</p>
       <h1>2)Age Limit:</h1>
       <p> The minimum age limit for candidates appearing in NEET is 17 years as of December 31 of the year of admission. There is no upper age limit as of 2022, although this has been subject to change, so it's essential to verify the latest information from the official sources.</p>
       <h1>3)Educational Qualification:
       </h1>
       <p>a)Candidates must have completed 10+2 or equivalent examination with Physics, Chemistry, Biology/Biotechnology, and English as core subjects.
        <br>
        b)Candidates appearing for the qualifying examination in the same year of the NEET exam are also eligible to apply.
        <br>
        c)For General category candidates, the minimum aggregate marks required in Physics, Chemistry, and Biology/Biotechnology in the qualifying examination is typically 50%. For reserved categories (SC/ST/OBC), the minimum aggregate marks may vary (usually around 40-45%).</p>
        <h1>4)Attempts</h1>
        <p>As of my last update, there was no limit on the number of attempts a candidate can make for NEET, as long as they fulfill the age and educational eligibility criteria. However, it's essential to verify the latest regulations from the official NEET website or NTA (National Testing Agency).</p>
        <h1>5)Mandatory Subjects:</h1>
        <p>Candidates must have studied Physics, Chemistry, Biology/Biotechnology, and English in their qualifying examination. The syllabus for NEET is based on the NCERT curriculum for classes 11 and 12.</p>
        <h1>6)Domicile Requirement:</h1>
        <p>There is no domicile requirement for appearing in the NEET exam. Candidates from any state or union territory of India can apply.</p>
        <h1></h1>
        <p>It's crucial to regularly check the official NEET website or NTA notifications for any updates or changes in the eligibility criteria as they can be subject to revision by the conducting authority.</p>
