        <p>The Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) is a prominent engineering entrance exam in India. It's conducted for admission to various undergraduate engineering programs in India, including the prestigious Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), National Institutes of Technology (NITs), Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs), and other centrally funded technical institutions.</p>
        <h1>There are two main components of the JEE:</h1>
        <h1>1)JEE Main: </h1>
        <p>This exam is the first step for students aspiring to pursue undergraduate engineering programs in India. It's conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA) and serves as the qualifying exam for JEE Advanced. JEE Main is held multiple times a year, usually in January and April.</p>
        <h1>2)JEE Advanced</h1>
        <p> This is the second stage of the Joint Entrance Examination and is meant for admission to the IITs. Only the top candidates from JEE Main are eligible to appear for JEE Advanced. It's considered one of the toughest engineering entrance exams in the world.</p>
        <p>The syllabus for both JEE Main and JEE Advanced includes subjects like Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics, covering topics taught in the 11th and 12th grades of the Indian education system.</p>
        <p>Preparing for JEE exams requires a thorough understanding of concepts, regular practice, and problem-solving skills. Many students start preparing for these exams well in advance, sometimes even from the 9th or 10th grade.</p>
        <p>Over the years, JEE exams have undergone several changes in terms of exam pattern, eligibility criteria, and the mode of examination. These changes are usually aimed at making the exams more inclusive and relevant to contemporary educational standards.</p>
        <p>Apart from IITs, NITs, and IIITs, several other prestigious institutions in India accept JEE scores for admission to their engineering programs. The JEE is highly competitive, with lakhs of students appearing for the exam each year, vying for a limited number of seats in the top engineering colleges.</p>
