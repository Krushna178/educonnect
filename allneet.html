       <p>NEET stands for the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test, which is a national level entrance examination in India for students who wish to pursue undergraduate medical (MBBS), dental (BDS), and related courses (like Ayurveda, Homeopathy, etc.) in government or private medical colleges across the country. Here are some key points about NEET:</p>
       <h1>1)Objective:</h1>
       <p>NEET is conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA) and aims to standardize the admission process to medical and dental colleges in India. It replaced multiple entrance exams previously held by various states and institutions.</p>
       <h1>2)Eligibility</h1>
       <p>To appear for NEET, a candidate must have completed 10+2 or equivalent with Physics, Chemistry, Biology/Biotechnology, and English as core subjects. The minimum age limit is 17 years, and there's a limit on the number of attempts.</p>
       <h1>3)Exam Structure</h1>
       <p>NEET is a three-hour exam consisting of 180 multiple-choice questions. The questions are divided equally among Physics, Chemistry, and Biology (Botany & Zoology). Each correct answer earns four marks, and there is a negative marking of one mark for each incorrect answer.</p>
       <h1>4)Scoring and Ranking:</h1>
       <p> NEET scores determine the eligibility of candidates for admission into medical and dental colleges. After the exam, NTA releases the answer key and OMR sheets for candidates to challenge if they find any discrepancies. Once the final results are declared, a national merit list is prepared based on the marks obtained.</p>
       <h1>5)Counselling and Admission</h1>
       <p>After the results, centralized counselling processes are conducted by various authorities for admission into MBBS and BDS courses in different states and institutions. Candidates are allotted seats based on their NEET rank, preferences, and availability of seats.</p>
       <h1>6)Attempts: </h1>
       <p>As of 2022, there was no limit to the number of attempts for NEET, provided the candidate met the eligibility criteria.</p>
       <h1>7)Syllabus:</h1>
       <p>NEET syllabus is based on the common topics covered in the NCERT curriculum for classes 11 and 12 in Physics, Chemistry, and Biology.</p>
       <h1>8)Language:</h1>
       <p>NEET is conducted in multiple languages including English, Hindi, Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Kannada, Marathi, Odia, Tamil, Telugu, and Urdu.</p>
       <h1></h1>
       <p>NEET is a crucial examination for students aspiring to pursue a career in medicine or dentistry in India, and it plays a significant role in shaping the future of medical education in the country.</p>
